# Basic Localization

Basic Localization is a Unity package that allows you easily and quickly translate your project into different languages.

Main features:

1. Simple UI for managing translations.
2. Works best for prototypes or game jams, but it also can handle a large number of translations (10k+ entries).
3. Supports export and import from a CSV file.

Limitations:

1. The library can handle only text, not images or audio.

## Installation

The Basic Localization package can be added by adding `com.m039.basic-localization` through the "Add package from git URL..." option in the Package Manager.
